# AHS DIY RotorFlight FC PCB

This is a diy pcb for F722 mcu based Rotorflight FC.
the pin arrangement is based on F7A1 Design Reference 

(https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight/wiki/Rotorflight-FC-Reference-Design#variants)

All the components have been placed on the top side for ease of assembly, the smallest components use are 0603 which makes it easier for soldering.

Gerber, BOM ,and fabrication files are attached above.

Components cost will be around 23$ from LCSC and PCB fabrication will be 7$ from JLCPCB.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions during assembly.
